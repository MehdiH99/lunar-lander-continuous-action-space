# lunar-lander-continuous-action-space
A continuous action space implementation of the Lunar Lander environment using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with multiple uncertainties. The agent learns to control the lander with smooth, continuous movements to safely land on the lunar surface. This project demonstrates reinforcement learning with continuous control.
